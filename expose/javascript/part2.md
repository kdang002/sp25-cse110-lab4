## Part 2
1. 3
2. 150
3. 150
4. It will return a list of discounted price on each responding item i: [50, 100, 150]
5. It will cause an error, because of the code is trying to print variable i, which doesn't exist in scope.
6. Same issue as #5, where discountedPrice uses a "let" keyword, therefore line 13 is accessing out-of-scope variable.
7. At line 14, it will print out 150.
8. It will return a list of discounted price on each responding item i: [50, 100, 150]
9. It will cause an error, because of the code is trying to print variable i, which doesn't exist in scope.
10. It will print out 3
11. It will return a list of discounted price on each responding item i: [50, 100, 150]
12. 
    A. student.name;
    B. student['Grad Year'];
    C. student.greeting();
    D. student['Favorite Teacher']['name'];
    E. student.courseLoad[0]

13. 
    A. '3' + 2 = '32'
    B. '3' - 2 = 1
    C. 3 + null = 3
    D. '3' + null = '3null'
    E. true + 3 = 4
    F. false + null = 0
    G. '3' + undefined = '3undefined'
    H. '3' - undefined = NaN

14. 
    A. '2' > 1 : True
    B. '2' < '12': False //Compare lexico where compare first letter '2' > '1'
    C. 2 == '2': True
    D. 2 === '2': false  // === is a strictly equality, does not allow type conversion
    E. true == 2: false
    F. true === Boolean(2): true   //Any number that is not 0, is true.

15. == allows type convertions. While === STRICTLY NO type conversion; data type must match.
